Only my second attempt at a python flask API. 

This was developed following DevOps best practices (To the best of my ability), providing endpoints for login authentication, database access etc.

A great many challenges were had with CORS.

This was deployed on a Linux VPS with automation to pull the latest version from the main branch.
